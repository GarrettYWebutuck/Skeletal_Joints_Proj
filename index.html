                <hr>
                <p>Joints are the places where two or more bones meet. They are held together in a way that stops them from falling apart but also in a way that they can be moved. Joints are also reffered to as 'articulations'. Joints are classified into two types: Functional and Structural.</p>

                <h2>Structural Joints</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Structural joints are the types of joints that you wouldn't really consider to be joints, but that doesnt mean they arent. They tend to be located in the axial skeleton so the Thoracic Cage (The Rib Cage), the Vertebral Column (The Spine), and the Skull but some are in the limbs. These joints are subclassified based on what type of tissue is inbetween the bones in the joint.</p>
                <h3>Types of Structural Joints</h3>

                        <h4>Fibrous Joints</h4>
                        <p>Fibrous joints have little to no movement.</p>
