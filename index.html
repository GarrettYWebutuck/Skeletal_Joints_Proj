            <h2>What are Joints?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Joints are the places where two or more bones meet. They are held together in a way that stops them from falling apart but also in a way that they can be moved. Joints are also reffered to as 'articulations'. Joints can be classified into two ways: Functional and Structural. From here on we will focus on the structural classification.</p>

            <h2>Types of Joints</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When using the structural classification of joints, there are three main subclassifications: Fibrous, Cartilaginous, and Synovial. These subclassifications are based on what separates the bones at a joint.</p>
            <h3>Structural Subclassifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fibrous Joints</h4>
                    <p>In fibrous joints, the bones are joined by fibrous tissue. The types of fibrous joints are called "Sutures", "Syndesmoses", and "Gomphoses". The places you would find these joints are in the seams of the skull growth plates to hold the skull together(Suture Joints), in the ankle to hold the tibia and fibula together(Syndesmoses Joints), and in the mouth to hold the teeth to the facial bones (Gomphoses Joints).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cartilaginous Joints</h4>
                    <p>Cartilaginous joints can have a little movement or no movement at all, it depends on the type of cartilage that joins the bones. The types of cartilaginous joints are called "Synchrondroses", and "Symphyses". Synchrondroses use hyaline cartilage to hold the bones together and are immovable. Places you will find this type of cartilaginous joint are the connection between the ribs and the sternum. Symphyses use disks of fibrocartilage to hold bones together and are slightly moveable. One of the places you will find this type of cartilaginous joint are the intervertebral disks in the spine.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Synovial Joints</h4>
                    <p>Synovial joints can move freely. Every joint in your limbs are synovial joints. The bones in synovial joints are separated by a joint cavity that contains synovial fluid. Every synovial joint has four unique features.</br></br>1. Articular (hyaline) cartilage covers the ends of the bones at the joint.<br/><br/>2. The joint surface is encasulated by an articular capsule made of fibrous tissue that is lined by a synovial membrane.</br></br>3.  The inside of the capsule is called the joint cavity and is filled with synovial fluid that is secreted by the synovial membrane.</br></br>4. The fibrous tissue in the synovial membrane is usually reinforced by ligaments.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    There are many types of synovial joints and they will be discussed in the next section.

            <h2>Types of Synovial Joints</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>The movements of synovial joints are determined by the shape of the bone in the joint.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Plane Joints</h4>
                    <p>The bones in these joints glide across each other. The joint is considered nonaxial because it doesnt rotate on any defined axis. The best example of this synovial joint are the carpal bones in the wrist.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Hinge Joints</h4>
                    <p>The bones in these joints move like a hinge. The joint is considered uniaxial because it rotates on only one defined axis. The best examples o fthis synovial joint are the knee, elbow, ankle, and phalanges joints.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Pivot Joints</h4>
                    <p>The bones in these joints rotate on their long axis. The joint is considered uniaxial because it rotates on only one defined axis. The best example of this joint is the pivot joint on your elbow that allows you to flip your hand over.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Condylar Joints</h4>
                    <p>The bones in these joints are connected by a sphere of bone in the middle that is part of one of the bones in the joint. This joint is considered biaxial because it allows for rotation on two defined axes. The best example of these joints is the joint that connects the finger to the palm.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Saddle Joints</h4>
                    <p>The bones in these joints are connected in the shape of a saddle. The joint is considered biaxial because it allows for rotation in two axes. The best exampe of this joint is the joint that connects the thumb to the wrist/palm.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Ball-And-Socket Joints</h4>
                    <p>These joints are connected by the spherical end of one of the bones in the spherical cavity of the other bone. These joints are considered multiaxial because they allow for rotation on more than two axes. The best examples of this joint are the shoulders and hips.</p>

            <h2>Joint Disorders</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>Joints, like any other part of the body can get injured or stop working correctly. The most common disorder is arthritis. There are many different types of arthritis. They all have some core symptoms as well as some symptoms that are unique to each type. The core sympotoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Osteoarthritis</h4>
                    <p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and occurs when the cartilage of the joint breaks down over time and the bones begin to create friction and gain small bone growths called bone spurs. Osteoarthritis can be painful if the joint is used too much but regular exersize can keep the joint for locking up.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h4>
                    <p>In rheumatoid arthritis the immune system attacks the joints causing inflammation. It is found that it is generally symetrical meaning if the left shoulder is afflicted then chances are the right shoulder is or will be as well. Rheumatoid arthritis can die down and flair up at any time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Gouty Arthritis</h4>
                    <p>In gouty arthritis, uric acid leaks into the bloodstream and crystalizes in soft tissues. If left untreated the joint can fuse and become immobile. gouty arthritis is extremely painful.</p>

            <p>These are some fun facts about skeletal joints.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>There is only one bone in the body that isnt part of a joint, called the Hyoid Bone. It is located in the neck and holds the tongue as well as translates some muscle movements to the jaw.</p>
