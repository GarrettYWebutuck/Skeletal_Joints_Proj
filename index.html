            <h2>What are Joints?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Joints are the places where two or more bones meet. They are held together in a way that stops them from falling apart but also in a way that they can be moved. Joints are also reffered to as 'articulations'. Joints can be classified into two ways: Functional and Structural. From here on we will focus on the structural classification.</p>

            <h2>Types of Joints</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When using the structural classification of joints, there are three main subclassifications: Fibrous, Cartilaginous, and Synovial. These subclassifications are based on what separates the bones at a joint.</p>
            <h3>Structural Subclassifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fibrous Joints</h4>
                    <p>In fibrous joints, the bones are joined by fibrous tissue. The types of fibrous joints are called "Sutures", "Syndesmoses", and "Gomphoses". The places you would find these joints are in the seams of the skull growth plates to hold the skull together(Suture Joints), in the ankle to hold the tibia and fibula together(Syndesmoses Joints), and in the mouth to hold the teeth to the facial bones (Gomphoses Joints).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cartilaginous Joints</h4>
                    <p>Like fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints have little to no movement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Synovial Joints</h4>
                    <p>Synovial joints can move freely, one such joint is your shoulder.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
